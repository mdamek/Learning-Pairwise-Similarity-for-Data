# Learning-Pairwise-Similarity-for-Data

Implementation and an attempt to improve the operation of Learning Pairwise Similarity clustering algorithms based on paper:

##### A. L. N. Fred and A. K. Jain, "Learning Pairwise Similarity for Data Clustering," 18th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR'06), 2006, pp. 925-928.

The theoretical introduction, the results and the course of the experiments were presented in the form of a science paper in collaboration with KÃ¼bra Duran.
